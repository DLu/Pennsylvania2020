# Pennsylvania 2020 Election Results
## Scraping
This code scrapes the results from [the official Pennsylvania election feeds](https://www.electionreturns.pa.gov/ElectionFeed/ElectionFeed). The raw data is written to the `raw_data` folder, timestamped by date. The HTML data within the feeds are then parsed and written to `data`, sorted by Election and Office.
